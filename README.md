What is a software bill of materials?
---

```
   A software bill of materials (SBOM) is a list of the software components in a given project and their corresponding version numbers and other metadata. The SBOM can be used to track updates and known security vulnerabilities for each component in the software projectâ€™s dependencies. It is also helpful for auditing purposes as it ensures that only authorized dependencies are included in a software project. While the SBOM is not directly used to manage software installation and removal, it is a solution leveraged by other tools to achieve the said capability.
